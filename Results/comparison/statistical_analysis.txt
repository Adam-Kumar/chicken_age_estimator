STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Model Size vs Fusion Strategy Effectiveness
================================================================================

1. CORRELATION ANALYSIS: Model Size vs Performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Spearman correlation coefficient measures monotonic relationship.
   Negative correlation = larger models have lower MAE (better performance)

   TOP View    :  rho = -0.6667  (p = 0.0499) *
   Late        :  rho = -0.7333  (p = 0.0246) *
   Feature     :  rho = -0.6000  (p = 0.0876) ns

   Interpretation:
   - More negative rho = stronger benefit from increased model size
   - *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, ns = not significant


2. FUSION BENEFIT ANALYSIS: Improvement Over TOP View Control
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Calculates: (TOP View MAE - Fusion MAE) / TOP View MAE
   Positive = Fusion is better, Negative = TOP View is better

   Improvement by Model Size (using TOP view params as reference):

   efficientnet_b0 (  4.0M params):
      Late    : + 27.34%
      Feature : + 22.96%
   resnet18        ( 11.2M params):
      Late    : + 23.11%
      Feature : + 26.97%
   resnet50        ( 23.5M params):
      Late    : + 31.05%
      Feature : + 25.35%
   resnet101       ( 42.5M params):
      Late    : + 28.19%
      Feature : + 28.40%
   vit_b_16        ( 86.6M params):
      Late    : + 10.44%
      Feature : + 12.98%
   swin_t          ( 27.5M params):
      Late    : + 25.39%
      Feature : + 23.48%
   swin_b          ( 87.3M params):
      Late    : + 27.61%
      Feature : + 21.64%
   convnext_t      ( 27.8M params):
      Late    : + 25.32%
      Feature : + 26.14%
   convnext_b      ( 88.0M params):
      Late    : + 23.61%
      Feature : + 24.84%


   Correlation: Model Size vs Fusion Benefit
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Late     Fusion:  rho = -0.1667  (p = 0.6682) ns
   Feature  Fusion:  rho = -0.2500  (p = 0.5165) ns

   Interpretation:
   - Positive rho = larger models benefit MORE from fusion
   - Negative rho = smaller models benefit MORE from fusion


3. CAPACITY THRESHOLD ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Identifies approximate model size where fusion becomes beneficial

   Late:
      Fusion wins at:     >=4.0M params  (models: efficientnet_b0, resnet18, resnet50, swin_t, convnext_t, resnet101, vit_b_16, swin_b, convnext_b)
      TOP View wins at:   Never (fusion always better)

   Feature:
      Fusion wins at:     >=4.0M params  (models: efficientnet_b0, resnet18, resnet50, swin_t, convnext_t, resnet101, vit_b_16, swin_b, convnext_b)
      TOP View wins at:   Never (fusion always better)



4. KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================
   - Feature Fusion shows WEAKER correlation with model size than TOP View
     (|rho_feature| = 0.6000 < |rho_top_view| = 0.6667)

   ~ No significant relationship between model size and fusion benefit
     (rho = -0.2500, p = 0.5165)
