================================================================================

================================================================================
1. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP SUMMARY
================================================================================

Models Tested: 27 total (9 backbones × 3 fusion strategies)

Backbones (9):
- Traditional CNN: EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101
- Transformer: ViT-B/16, Swin-T, Swin-B
- Modernized CNN: ConvNeXt-T, ConvNeXt-B

Fusion Strategies (3):
- TOP View Only (baseline): Single encoder, top view image only
- Late Fusion: Separate encoders for TOP + SIDE, concatenate final features
- Feature Fusion: Separate encoders for TOP + SIDE, fuse at intermediate layer

Validation: 3-Fold Cross-Validation (chicken-level splits to prevent data leakage)
Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in days

================================================================================

- Right panel: Scatter plot showing model size vs performance

ARCHITECTURE PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
| Architecture     | Mean MAE | Std MAE | Best MAE | Params Range |
|------------------|----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Modernized CNN   | 0.687    | 0.024   | 0.662    | 27.8-176M    |
| Transformer      | 0.708    | 0.042   | 0.660    | 27.5-175M    |

================================================================================
4. FUSION STRATEGY COMPARISON
================================================================================

GRAPH: fusion_comparison.png
- Left panel: Box plot showing distribution across 9 backbones
- Right panel: Bar chart with mean ± std and ANOVA result

FUSION PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
| Strategy    | Mean MAE | Std MAE | Min MAE | Max MAE |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Late        | 0.755    | 0.093   | 0.662   | 0.935   |
| Feature     | 0.761    | 0.108   | 0.660   | 0.922   |
| TOP View    | 0.815    | 0.103   | 0.710   | 0.966   |

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
- ANOVA F-statistic: 0.95
- ANOVA p-value: 0.399 (NOT SIGNIFICANT)
- Interpretation: No statistically significant difference between fusion strategies
  when averaged across all backbones

KEY FINDINGS:
- Late and Feature fusion perform similarly on average
- Both multi-view strategies improve over TOP View baseline
- TOP View baseline: 0.815 MAE
- Best improvement: Late fusion reduces MAE by 7.4% vs baseline
- Feature fusion reduces MAE by 6.6% vs baseline

PER-BACKBONE IMPROVEMENT (Late vs TOP View):

- ResNet-18: +15.6% improvement
- ViT-B/16: +8.4% improvement
- ConvNeXt-T: +6.7% improvement

DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Multi-view information consistently helps but effect varies by backbone
- SIDE view provides complementary decay information
- Simpler architectures benefit MORE from multi-view fusion
- Modern architectures extract more from single view, less marginal gain from fusion
- ANOVA non-significant because improvement is backbone-dependent

================================================================================
5. MODEL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

GRAPH: model_size_vs_performance.png
- Scatter plot: X = Parameters (log scale), Y = MAE
- Shows Spearman correlation per fusion strategy

CORRELATIONS (Model Size vs MAE):
- TOP View: rho = -0.600 (larger models = better, moderate correlation)
- Feature:  rho = -0.533 (larger models = better, moderate correlation)
- Late:     rho = -0.200 (weak correlation)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Negative correlation: larger models generally perform better
- But relationship is weak, especially for Late fusion
- Most efficient model: ConvNeXt-T Feature
  - MAE: 0.665, Parameters: 28.59M
  - Best performance-to-size ratio
- ConvNeXt-T Late achieves 0.662 MAE with only 55.64M params
  - Comparable to ViT-B/16 Feature (0.660 MAE, 87.34M params)

DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Model size alone doesn't determine performance
- Architecture design more important than raw parameter count
- ConvNeXt offers excellent efficiency (good for deployment)
- Diminishing returns beyond ~60M parameters

--- GRAPH: error_distribution_vit_b_16_feature.png ---
- Left: Histogram of prediction errors
- Right: Q-Q plot for normality assessment

ERROR STATISTICS:
- Mean error: +0.163 days (slight tendency to over-predict)
- Distribution approximately normal (Q-Q plot follows diagonal)
- Most errors within ±1 day range
- Few extreme errors (>2 days)

DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Slight positive bias suggests model tends to estimate older
- Normal distribution validates use of MAE as metric

7. PER-DAY PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

GRAPH: per_day_performance_vit_b_16_feature.png
- Bar chart showing MAE for each day (1-7)
- Error bars = standard deviation
- Red line = overall MAE (0.691)

PER-DAY MAE:
| Day | MAE   | Std   | Performance vs Overall |
|-----|-------|-------|------------------------|
| 1   | 0.934 | 0.66  | WORST (+35% error)     |
| 2   | 0.734 | 0.54  | Above average          |
| 3   | 0.653 | 0.51  | Below average (good)   |

| 6   | 0.465 | 0.42  | BEST (-33% error)      |
| 7   | 0.636 | 0.56  | Below average (good)   |

KEY FINDINGS:
- Day 6 easiest to predict (MAE: 0.465)
- Day 1 hardest to predict (MAE: 0.934)
- Performance follows U-shape: worst at extremes, best in middle-late
- Day 1 high error likely due to: fresh chicken appearance varies widely
- Day 6-7 may have more distinctive decay features (discoloration, texture)

DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Fresh chicken (Day 1) has high natural variation in appearance
- Middle-late days show consistent decay progression
- Day 6 optimal: clear decay signs but not yet extreme
- Could inform sampling strategies for future data collection

| SIDE | 0.180           | 0.03 | 1.0 |

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- TOP view shows higher mean activation (0.215 vs 0.180)
- Model focuses on central chicken region (not background)
- Activation patterns differ between views
- High activation areas correspond to:
  - Skin discoloration regions
  - Surface texture changes
  - Areas showing moisture/dryness changes

GRAPH: gradcam_summary.png
- Summary statistics across all samples
- Activation vs prediction error analysis

FINDINGS:
- No strong correlation between activation intensity and error
- Both views contribute to predictions (neither dominates)
- TOP view slightly more informative (higher activation)
- Model correctly learns to focus on chicken, not container/background

DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Model learns meaningful features (not spurious correlations)
- Dual-view attention validates multi-view fusion approach
- Interpretable predictions increase trust in system
- Could guide future sensor placement for practical deployment
