# chicken_age_estimator
Deep learning models for chicken drumette age estimation (1-7 days) from multi-view images. Implements three PyTorch architectures: Baseline ResNet50, Late Fusion (averaging), and Feature Fusion (concatenation). Late Fusion achieves best performance (0.430 MAE) on small datasets through ensemble-like strategy.
